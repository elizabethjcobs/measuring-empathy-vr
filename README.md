# Empathy Measurement in VR: Avatar Realism and Empathy Induction
This project explores how varying levels of avatar realism in virtual reality (VR) affect empathy induction. By manipulating avatar realism, we measure the impact on both trait and state empathy responses. The repository includes code for analysing empathy measures and investigating the relationship between avatar realism and empathy induction in VR environments.

Key Features:
- Empathy Measurement: Code for measuring trait and state empathy responses.
- Analysis: Scripts for analysing how avatar realism influences empathy in VR-based scenarios.
