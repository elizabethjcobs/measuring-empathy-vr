# Empathy Measurement in VR: Avatar Realism and Empathy Induction
This project explores how varying levels of avatar realism in virtual reality (VR) affect empathy induction. VR serves as a powerful "empathy machine," enabling researchers to study how immersive environments influence trait and state empathy responses. By manipulating avatar realism, we measure its impact on empathy in VR.

Key Features:
- Empathy Measurement: Code for measuring trait and state empathy responses.
- Analysis: Scripts for analysing how avatar realism influences empathy in VR-based scenarios.
This project explores how varying levels of avatar realism in virtual reality (VR) affect empathy induction. VR serves as a powerful "empathy machine," enabling researchers to study how immersive environments influence cognitive and affective empathy responses. By manipulating avatar realism, we measure its impact on empathy in VR.
