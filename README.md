# Empathy Measurement in VR: Avatar Realism and Empathy Induction
This project explores how varying levels of avatar realism in virtual reality (VR) affect empathy induction. VR is a powerful "empathy machine" that can evoke emotional and cognitive empathy by immersing participants in controlled environments. By manipulating avatar realism, we measure its impact on empathy responses, co-presence, and other relevant psychological factors.

Key Features:
- Empathy Measurement: Code for measuring trait and state empathy responses.
- Analysis: Scripts for analysing how avatar realism influences empathy in VR-based scenarios.
- Co-presence Scores: Analysis of participant co-presence during VR exposure. Co-presence is defined as the feeling of being together with a virtual character in the immersive environment.
- Manipulation Checks: Code to check whether different levels of avatar realism influence participants' perception of the avatar.
- Time Checks: Time-tracking to measure how long participants engage with the stimuli during the VR session.


## Avatar Realism Comparison:
All of our avatars were created from open-access resources. 
The following image showcases the differences in avatar realism used in this study:
